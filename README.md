# vanilla-js-todos
an evolving todo list

This is a SPA that began as a generically wriiten and styled Todo list program in vanilla js. I learned to build it from a youtube tutorial that, in my opinion, was bugg-y and written with code that did not adhere to what are reffered to as "best practices". The purpose of putting it on Github's cloud is so that I can track the trajectory once I begin to refactor as an exercize technique using learned best practices from here on out. 

I aim to apply agile concepts, such as Test-Driven-Development (TDD) and es6 moduality. Some history will showcase using class components whereas some functional. It is my intention that this program evolve into possessing new features and aforementioned div components reminiscent of, and nearly analogous to, the performance and maintainability of that of a Reactjs applicatio; yet I will endeavor to refrain from accessing any of Reactjs' lib methods. ReactJS will thus serve as some form of frames of reference.
